 *
 * This build of GCLI for Firefox comes from 4 bits of code:
 * - prefix-gcli.jsm: Initial commentary and EXPORTED_SYMBOLS
 * - console.js: Support code common to web content that is not part of the
 *   default firefox chrome environment and is easy to shim.
 * - mini_require: A very basic commonjs AMD (Asynchronous Modules Definition)
 *   'require' implementation (which is just good enough to load GCLI). For
 *   more, see http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition.
 *   This alleviates the need for requirejs (http://requirejs.org/) which is
 *   used when running in the browser. This code is provided by dryice.
 * - A build of GCLI itself, packaged using dryice
 * - suffix-gcli.jsm - code to require the gcli object for EXPORTED_SYMBOLS.
 *
 * See Makefile.dryice.js for more details of this build.
 * For more details on dryice, see the https://github.com/mozilla/dryice
